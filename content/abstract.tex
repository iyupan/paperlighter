\begin{abstract}
Using \LaTeX{} to write papers is concise and convenient. However, for writing in life, complicated \LaTeX{} style-files (e.g., elegantpaper) are difficult to access, or submission style-files (e.g., journal or conference) are not free indeed. To tackle these problems and satisfy an elegant and straightforward scientific writing, \textbf{paperlighter.sty}, a one-column style-file, is designed. This document is edited from icml2022.sty and provides a basic paper template. Compared to icml2022.sty, paperlighter.sty contain fewer operations, reducing adjustment while keep graceful. \textbf{\textit{Notably, the paper's main content only describes the format of icml2022.sty. We place the content to show the actual effect of paperlighter.sty.}}
